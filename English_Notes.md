This is going to be my personal notebook if I need to take notes in English. Also it will be my personal dictionary.

# How to learn anything fast.

I'm pursuing how to learn anyhting faster. I want to become really good at this. To start this journey, I'm going to watch videos in YouTtube and takes notes about it. If I don't know the meaning of some word or phrase, I'll use these notes to write them down.

Learning is a 2 stage process.

One is active engagement and focus.

In order lo learn at any age the most critical thing is that you bring **as much focus and active engagement to the learning, the encoding of the information, bringing in the information.** And then that you get into a state of deep sleep as quickly as possible. Tipically that would be the night after you learn.

People who take a 20 minute nap within the 4 hours after a trigeering learning or people that do a non sleep deep rest type protocol (even just sitting there quietly and not doing anything), they learn much faster.
