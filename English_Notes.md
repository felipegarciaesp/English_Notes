This is going to be my personal notebook if I need to take notes in English. Also it will be my personal dictionary.

# How to learn anything fast.

I'm pursuing how to learn anyhting faster. I want to become really good at this. To start this journey, I'm going to watch videos in YouTtube and takes notes about it. If I don't know the meaning of some word or phrase, I'll use these notes to write them down.

Learning is a 2 stage process.

One is active engagement and focus.

In order lo learn at any age the most critical thing is that you bring **as much focus and active engagement to the learning, the encoding of the information, bringing in the information.** And then that you get into a state of deep sleep as quickly as possible. Tipically that would be the night after you learn.

People who take a 20 minute nap within the 4 hours after a trigeering learning or people that do a non sleep deep rest type protocol (even just sitting there quietly and not doing anything), they learn much faster. In other words, the brain rewires much faster.

Get as focused as you can, but then relax as deeply as you can.

Practice cycles on being focused by 90 minutes. You are not gonna be like a beam of focus for 90 minutes, this is not going to be the case. You can flicker in and out, you're gonna get distracted, you bring yourself back. **Focus is an active process of bringing that spotlight of attention back.**

Anxiety some times that we feel is Adrenaline. 

Recommendations: be focused for 90 minutes and after that you should really take a break and let your mind go idle somewhat. Ideally you take a 20-30 minute nap or do a non sleep deep rest protocol within the first hour to 4 hours after that.

Gap learning effects: if every couple of minutes (just randomly during your intense learning or focus) you pause and you just take 10 seconds and do nothing, just let your brain idle, eyes open or eyes closed, what happens is that your rates of learning actually increase.

All the tools the people use to enhance focus (ritalin, aderall, L tyrosine, excessive amounts of caffeine, nicotine) help with the trigger part but they don't help with the relaxation part.

**A lot of people don't learn, they just get really good at doing but they don't actually learn**

The people who are really good at something it is because they are good at regulating the seesaw of focus/relax.

People that Dr Huberman considers very successful in multiple domains of life are those who have the ability to engage and disengage. Deliberately engage and deliberately disengage.

**GREAT SLEEP MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER**

# How to manage Time

I'm also pursuing how to be more productive in my life, not only at work but in my daily tasks. On this section I'm going to write down notes about videos of this subject that I watched.

## 1st video: Maximize Productivity With These Time Management Tools | Dr. Cal Newport & Dr. Andrew Huberman

Fix the schedule and don't work outside of that schedule. It is your move to figure it out, anything you want to do, you have to make that work. You want to become a professor? Figure it out how to make that work. You don't have the option of just throwing hours at it. You innovate a lot when you have the constraints.

```
I really like this aprroach, it would help me out to be more productive during the day. I don't have all the time of the world!
```

Dr. Cal Newport introduces the idea of slow productivity, which means that you may take your time to do something. Try not to be dependent on any particular day being critical on what you. For example if you want to write a chapter for the book you are writing on, don't set the goal on finish it by a particular day, instead do it on the current month.

**seesaw:** A long plank balanced in the middle on a fixed point (fulcrum) that moves up and down; it can also refer to a situation that moves back and forth between extremes. "The stock market has been on a seesaw, fluctuating wildly between gains and losses."
